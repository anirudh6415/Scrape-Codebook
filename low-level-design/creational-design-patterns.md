# Creational Design Patterns

## Singleton

> A design pattern that guarantees a class has only one instance and is used as a global point of access to it.
>
> That is the one class will instantiate itself and make sure to create one instance.

Singletons are the simplest patterns, but harder to implement. There are multiple ways to implement the Singleton pattern.

### 1. Lazy Initialization

* The singleton instance is created only when it is first requested.
* Saves memory if the instance is never used.
* Simple to implement, but not thread-safe in its basic form.

### 2. Thread-safe Singleton&#x20;

* Ensures only one instance is created, even in multithreaded environments.
* Uses a mutex or lock to synchronize access during instance creation.
* Slightly slower due to locking overhead.

### 3. Double-check locking

* Reduces locking overhead by checking the instance twice: before and after acquiring the lock.
* Thread-safe and more efficient than always locking.
* Slightly more complex to implement correctly

### 4. Eager initialization

* The instance is created at program startup, regardless of whether itâ€™s used.
* Simple and inherently thread-safe.
* It may waste resources if the instance is never needed.

### 5. Bill Pugh Singleton

* Uses a static local variable or inner class for lazy, thread-safe initialization.
* An instance is created only when needed, and thread safety is guaranteed.

### 6. Enum Singleton

* Uses an enum type to guarantee a single instance.
* Simple and prevents issues with serialization and reflection.

### 7. Stack Block Initialization

* Uses a static variable declared inside a method for thread-safe, lazy initialization.
* Simple, efficient, and thread-safe.

### Pros and Cons of the Singleton pattern

| 1. Ensures a single instance of a class and provides a global point of access to it.            | 1. Violates the Single Responsibility Principle: The pattern solves two problems at the same time.                       |
| 2. Only one object is created, which can be particularly beneficial for resource-heavy classes. | 2. In multithreaded environments, special care must be taken to implement Singletons correctly to avoid race conditions. |
| 3. Provides a way to maintain global state within an application.                               | 3. Introduces global state into an application, which might be difficult to manage.                                      |
| 4. Supports lazy loading, where the instance is only created when it's first needed.            | 4. Classes using the singleton can become tightly coupled to the singleton class.                                        |
| 5. Guarantees that every object in the application uses the same global resource.               | 5. Singleton patterns can make unit testing difficult due to the global state it introduces.                             |
